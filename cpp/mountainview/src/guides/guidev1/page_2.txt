Every detected event ends up in a cluster. As such, some clusters have a large proportion of outliers and noise events.

Click on "Event Filter" in the left panel. For outlier score, we suggest a value of 3. For detectability score, we suggest a value of 6. See the manuscript for details on these metrics. 

Click on the checkbox to enable the event filter. Then use the "Recalc" button to recalculate the views. 
     
Some clusters may have disappeared, now containing 0 spikes. Reject these clusters by selecting all of them —> Right click —> Add Tag —> rejected.

You can hide/show differently labeled cluster groupings using the cluster visibility options on the control panel.
